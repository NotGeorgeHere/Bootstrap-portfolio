# George Ryder - BootStrap Portfolio

## Description

My main motivation behind this project was to work on my understanding of Bootstrap 4. Before working on this project, my understanding of Bootstrap was very limited and therefore this project was vital in improving my understanding of the concepts that make up Bootstrap and how they can be applied to future projects. I built this project not only to improve my understanding of Bootstrap but also to have a responsive portfolio that I can show off to prospective employers as it gets filled with projects. This helps to solve the problem of not having a place to show off my projects whilst also creating a way for employers to contact me. Additionally, it helps to show I have experience using Bootstrap, which is the world's most popular framework to build repsonsive, mobile first sites. This, again, helps to show that I have experience in using this framework and would make me more appealing to employers. I learnt a lot throughout this project and was able to successfully overcome hurdles that I faced. One issue faced was to do with setting up the columns properly to display and not overlap eachother when displaying on mobile devices. Through experimentation and asking questions I was able to figure it out and now my portfolio displays properly on any size display. Additionally, I also improved my understanding of the Bootstrap framework and also how to customise elements within this framework. Throughout the portfolio the NavBar, jumbotron, buttons, card images where all altered from the template that the Bootstrap documentation provides. This project stands out as it is a personal portfolio meaning prospective employers can see information that is relevevant to myself once projects have been added instead of the current placeholders.
